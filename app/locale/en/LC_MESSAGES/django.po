msgid "service_content_3"
msgstr "Sublimation refers to the process where sublimation ink is heated to a specific temperature, causing the dye to transition from a solid to a gas. As the temperature decreases, the dye reverts to a solid state, permeating the surface of the transferred item, achieving the goal of sublimation. Due to the high sublimation temperature, it does not fade with long-term use, and the process does not produce wastewater, making it environmentally friendly and safe."
